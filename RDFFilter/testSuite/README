SIMPLE RDF TEST SUITE

This directory contains simple tests for RDF processors.  Currently,
these test only error-reporting, not tuple reporting.

All of the tests in the bad/ directory are well-formed XML but
malformed RDF, and should cause RDF processors to report errors; see
the comments at the beginning of each test for details.

Eventually, the good/ directory will contain tests that are both
well-formed XML and well-formed RDF, and should not cause RDF
processors to report errors.
